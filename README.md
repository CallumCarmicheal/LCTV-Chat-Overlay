# LCTV-Chat-Overlay
A web overlay that can be used as a Livestream window source with a chroma key to have a chat overlay when users are talking in the channel.

# Status
In Development
Kinda usable at the moment:

NOTE: THERE IS NO GUI FOR THE CLIENT AS OF YET, i am trying to find a system like Toastr that can queue/buffer chat messages for 5 seconds and stop the counter for ones hidden/shown offscreen!
